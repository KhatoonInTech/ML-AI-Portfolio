\

## **Introduction**

\

The dataset utilized in this project is the MNIST dataset, which comprises 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). This dataset is divided into a training set containing 60,000 images and a testing set with 10,000 images. Each image is represented as a 28x28 pixel matrix. The primary objective of this analysis is to develop a classification model capable of accurately predicting the digit represented in each image.

\

## **Data Analysis and Visualization**

\

#### ***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided several key insights:***

- **Dataset Structure**: The training set consists of 60,000 samples, while the testing set contains 10,000 samples. Each image is initially represented as a 2D array of shape (28, 28), which is then flattened into a 1D vector of 784 pixels.
- **Feature Normalization**: The pixel values were normalized using Min-Max Scaling to a range of [0, 1]. This normalization is crucial for improving the convergence and performance of the machine learning algorithms.
- **Target Encoding**: The target labels were converted into a one-hot encoded format using OneHotEncoder, transforming categorical labels (digits 0-9) into a binary format suitable for multi-class classification. The training labels were reshaped to a 2D format, resulting in a shape of (60,000, 10).
- **Visualization**: A sample image from the dataset was displayed using Matplotlib, confirming the clarity and structure of the data.

\

## **Model Building**
\
### **Model Architecture**

The model was constructed using the Keras Sequential API, consisting of the following layers:
- **Hidden Layer 1**: A dense layer with 300 neurons and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation, designed to learn complex patterns from the input data.
- **Hidden Layer 2**: Another dense layer with 100 neurons and ReLU activation, further refining the feature extraction process.
- **Output Layer**: A dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation, providing probabilities for each of the 10 classes.

The model was compiled with the following parameters:
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer was chosen for its efficiency in handling large datasets and adaptively adjusting the learning rate.
- **Loss Function**: Categorical crossentropy was used as the loss function, suitable for multi-class classification problems.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy was specified as the evaluation metric to assess the model's performance during training.

The model was trained for 10 epochs on the training dataset, with the training process monitored through loss and accuracy metrics.

\

## **Model Evaluation**

\

The model's performance was evaluated based on accuracy and loss metrics over the training epochs:
- **Epoch 1**: Accuracy = 89.91%, Loss = 0.3485
- **Epoch 2**: Accuracy = 97.29%, Loss = 0.0856
- **Epoch 3**: Accuracy = 98.19%, Loss = 0.0568
- **Epoch 4**: Accuracy = 98.71%, Loss = 0.0415
- **Epoch 5**: Accuracy = 98.99%, Loss = 0.0304
- **Epoch 6**: Accuracy = 99.20%, Loss = 0.0265
- **Epoch 7**: Accuracy = 99.41%, Loss = 0.0177
- **Epoch 8**: Accuracy = 99.51%, Loss = 0.0142
- **Epoch 9**: Accuracy = 99.51%, Loss = 0.0163
- **Epoch 10**: Accuracy = 99.56%, Loss = 0.0136

The final model achieved a training accuracy of **99.56%**, indicating a strong performance in classifying handwritten digits. The training loss decreased consistently across epochs, demonstrating effective learning.
